### Wordpress Seed Theme

Version 1.

This is a simple Bootstrap seed theme with Bower and Gulp interactions. We have removed all bloat and unnecessary code from this theme, so it doesn't have multilanguage support, widgets, sidebars or any such clutter. It should be considered a base theme for developing using Advanced Custom Fields and using Wordpress as a pure CMS.

This utilises Yarn for dependency management - https://yarnpkg.com/

Once you have installed it, simply run:

	yarn

And you should be good to go.

Remove the contents of ```acf-json``` if you want to start from scratch.

#### General
